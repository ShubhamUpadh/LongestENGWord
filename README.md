# LongestENGWord

This is a simple app that has been inspired by the video -> https://youtu.be/zp4BMR88260

You have to enter the alphabets that you don't want the OUTPUT word to contain.
The input field will accept any input (alphabets, numeric, special characters) and only the unique alphabets will be considered.

Eg -> Input "a!A3232,,,32bnm" will be interpreted as "abnm"
